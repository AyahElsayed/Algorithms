Complexity of Common Operations
------------------------------
Complexity      |	Operation
O(1) 	           Running a statement
O(1) 	           Value look-up on an array, object, variable
O(logn)            Loop that cuts problem in half every iteration
O(n) 	           Looping through the values of an array
O(n^2)         	   Double nested loops
O(n^3) 	           Triple nested loops
